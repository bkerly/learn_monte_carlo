# Learning Monte Carlo

Basically, probably need to know more about monte carlo simulations, so I'm going to work through some tutorials here.

According to Wikipedia (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method>),

>
> **Monte Carlo methods**, or **Monte Carlo experiments**, are a broad class of [computational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation "Computation") [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") that rely on repeated [random sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_sampling "Random sampling") to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use [randomness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness "Randomness") to solve problems that might be [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_system "Deterministic system") in principle. They are often used in [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") and [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics") problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes:^[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#cite_note-1)^ [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization "Optimization"), [numerical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration "Numerical integration"), and generating draws from a [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution "Probability distribution").

So that's good!

Anyway, I'll link to the source articles as I work through a few of these.
